    "2": "Yes, what question do you have?",
    "3": "I would like to know how lambda functions work.",
    "4": "Sure, lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events.",
    "5": "The advantage of lambda functions is that it automatically manages the compute resource and you only pay for what you use.",

    "7": "Python, NodeJS, Java, Ruby among others...",
    "8": "Thank you all for your help. Things are much clearer now.",
