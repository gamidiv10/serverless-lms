## Getting Started

The company DALSoft5410 wants to build a solution is a Learning Management System (LMS) called DALServerlessLMS based in serverless technologies using a multi-cloud deployment model and backend-as-a-service (BaaS). DALSoft5410 wants to use a serverless solution because it does not have the sufficient resources for an on-premises solution. AWS and GCP are the cloud provider's selected by the company for building, testing, and deploying the solution. The application will provide instructors and students with a platform with the following features:
•	User management module: for sign up validation, managing and storing user details
•	Authentication module: for user multifactor authentication logic
•	Online support module: to provide an online virtual assistance, which can respond to questions from users
•	Chat Module: to discuss about general topics with all the users within the organization
•	Data processing module: to extract named entities from files in the LMS and build a word cloud
•	Machine learning module: to identify the classification of the file and add appropriate tags
•	Analysis 2 module: to identify the sentiment analysis of the chat messages from the Chat module
•	Web application: front-end application that calls the backend services

The project uses the React Js  web framework for the front end and backend was developed using the various cloud services provided by AWS and GCP

The backend codes are available in the the following folders

•	Chat Module
•	Data Processing
•	Machine Learning
•	Online Assistant Module
•	Sentiment Analysis
•	User Management and Authentication

## Testing the web application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
